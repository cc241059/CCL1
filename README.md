### ✍️ What Went Well:
**Creative Design:** The character sprites and animations turned out great, and I really enjoyed designing the attack and jump sequences.
Core Mechanics: The basic fighting mechanics, like movement and attack handling, worked smoothly and provided a satisfying player experience.

**Challenges:**
Time Constraints: Due to the limited timeframe, I couldn't implement all the planned features, like special moves or more complex AI.
Bug Fixes: Debugging collisions, especially with attack hitboxes and ensuring proper health updates, was a bit challenging.

**Lessons Learned:**
Prototyping Matters: Getting a basic prototype up and running quickly allowed me to focus on refining the core gameplay, like attack mechanics and movement.
Keep it Simple: By focusing on the core mechanics and polishing them, the game feels more cohesive and enjoyable, rather than overwhelming players with too many features.
