13.01.2025 - Today I was trying to make menu and working base of the game, the biggest problem was to implement OOP and to make the code as readable as possible.
14.01.2025 - My fight with OOP still continues but I'm getting there :)
15.01.2025 - I had to change logic in my code so it's simplier, had troubles with how the attacking works.
16.01.2025 - I managed to find how attacking works and I will try to implement that in my code, I had to go a few steps back and now Im trying to redo my code again aswell.
17.01.2025 - Attacks works, I found out my code is a mess so I had a bit of a breakdown and realised I need to change the whole logic behind me code :D Wish me luck
18.01.2025/19.01.2025 - Its a weekend but I was working to make my code OOP and I've successfully done it. Im proud and glat that I don't need to redo the whole game.
20.01.2O25 - I've successfully implemented spritesheets. It was a tough fight but after a couple of hours I was able to make them work as I wanted to so overall a success.
21.01.2025 - I was doing a little adjustments to the game as for example attack distance and I've changed spritesheets for attack animation.
22.01.2025 - Added health potions which spawn every 10seconds and add 20 health to the player to make the game more exiting, also somehow the attacks didn't work as I wanted them to do so I had to adjust it over again. I started drawing characters aswell and their animations.
23.01.2025 - I started drawing, I did not enjoy it for the most of the time and my hand hurts from drawing already :D
24.01.2025 - Still drawing...Finishing touches and I decided to completely change the background I've had so I'm fighting with submission time aswell. I managed to do it on time yupii :D
